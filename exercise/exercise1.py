# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
#
# Extras:
#
#     Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.
#     (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
#     Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.
#     (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

# name_input = input("Your name: ")
# age = int(input("Your age: "))
# year_when_100 = 2021 - age + 100
# print("year you turn 100:" + str(year_when_100))

print("test \n" * 4)

# DONE
